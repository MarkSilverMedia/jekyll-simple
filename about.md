## About Me

It's Mark! (the exclaimation point is silent)

I'm just some (sarcastic) guy on the internet that makes music, does stuff in linux (wow, ain't I a nerd?), and occasionally writes things (posts, articles, code, etc). Navigating this website should help you find everything you may be looking for.

## About This Website

This website is my personal little project that serves in part as my personal little portfolio (omg; redundant wording!), and in part as my own venue to talk about literally anything I feel like. This website is generated with Jekyll and written in Markdown. I host this website in [one of my github repos](https://github.com/MarkSilverMedia/marksilvermedia.github.io), which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (so feel free to fork my source code).
