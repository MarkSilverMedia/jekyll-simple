<h2>Boycott List</h2>

<p>What follows is a list of websites that I avoid using, or am in the process of avoiding, but don&#39;t maintain an account on. I recommend you avoid these websites as well.</p>

<ul>

<li>Facebook does not respect the freedom, privacy, or security of its users. It&#39;s "Real Name" policy is enough to have always kept me away, as I prefer to browse the web pseudonymously, but it&#39;s not Facebook&#39;s only flaw. <a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">Read More.</a></li>

<li>Twitter requires users to provide their phone number after having an account on their service for a short amount of time, and will lock your account until you do. Not only is this invasive, but it&#39;s also dumb. Why require email verification if you&#39;re gonna require phone verification later? Also, it&#39;s pretty shady to not require a phone number at registration, since it is a requirement to using their service. Let the users know what they&#39;re getting into before they sign onto it, twatters.</li>

<li>YouTube does not respect its viewers for many reasons. Older web browsers may be unable to watch YouTube videos because of the convoluted Javascript required to run the website. <a href="https://archive.org">The Internet Archive</a> because you can view/download videos from there regardless of what browser you&#39;re using. Furthermore, when you watch a YouTube video from their website, it connects your browser to a number of other domains that in a "Keep It Simple, Stupid" website. Some of these external domains are trackers used to map out your watching habits, which infringes upon your privacy. If YouTube used the native HTML5 player built into most browsers, the accessibility and tracking problems would be solved, & their site would load much faster. But, alas. Google/YouTube are still friggin&#39; stupid.</li>

<li>CNN is fake news. Heck, cable is dumb; screw &#39;em all.</li>

<li>Microsoft sucks. EULAs that give them full control over devices running their operating system. Backdoors that make the system more vulnerable than your 90-year-old grandma. Overpriced software in the form of Microsoft Office, which you could freely(both gratis and libre) replace with LibreOffice. Everything about Skype nowadays. It&#39;s all despicable. On July 27th of 2017, my Microsoft account is finally deactivated. Good riddance.</li>

<li>Apple sucks too, BUT I&#39;ll give them a free pass. Their computing devices are despicable in every way, but they can sure make damn good earbuds. Seriously. I use Earpods in my day-to-day music stuff, & their sound quality matches that of my full-sized over-the-ear headphones. If Apple does one thing well, it&#39;s these Earpods, I tell you h&#39;wat. You don&#39;t need non-free software to use &#39;em, so vote with your wallet and make Earpods the only damn thing you buy from Apple.</li>

</ul>
