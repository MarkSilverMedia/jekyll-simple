Being a bit of an internet hermit, I'm not quite as social as I oughtta be. For the same reason, however, I am on social media. What follows is the list of social media sites and whatnot I'm active on.

**[Minds](https://www.minds.com/MarkSilverMedia)** - Ah, yes. The shitpost memeland of the internet... oh wait, that's 4chan. Minds is a pro-free-speech and open-sourced alternative to the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube all rolled into one. If you're looking for a mix of sociopolitical memeing alongside my music and articles, feel free to follow me over there.
