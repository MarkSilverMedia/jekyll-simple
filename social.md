Being a bit of an internet hermit, I'm not quite as social as I oughtta be. For the same reason, however, I am on social media. What follows is the list of social media sites and whatnot I'm active on.

**[Minds](https://www.minds.com/MarkSilverMedia)** - Ah, yes. The shitpost memeland of the internet... oh wait, that's 4chan. Minds is a pro-free-speech and open-sourced alternative to the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube all rolled into one. If you're looking for a mix of sociopolitical memeing alongside my music and articles, feel free to follow me over there.

**[Mastodon](https://mastodon.rocks/@MarkSilverMedia)** - It's twitter... but not really. This one's decentralised, so there's none of that censorship business. If you want short posts about random things in addition to my regular content, follow me over there.

**[Vidme](https://vid.me/MarkSilverMedia)** - It's youtube... but not really (lol, I made the same joke twice). Vidme is a video hosting platform that respects its content creators and viewers alike. If you want to view some video content of mine, this is the place.

**[Github](https://github.com/MarkSilverMedia)** - Not really a social network, but you can interact with me on here, so I've put it on this page. As you may know, this website is hosted on Github. As you may also know, I do a bit of coding on an infrequent basis. If you like that kind of stuff, feel free to follow me or fork my repos or whatever you gitters want to do.

**Discord** - One of my friends uses this to contact me, so I therefore have a presence here. Discord is a great alternative to Skype that is just better because Skype is owned by Microsoft and Microsoft is evil. If you want to be Discord friends, add me at MarkSilverMedia #6916.

**Email** - When you average it out, I only log onto Discord about once a week. Email, however, I check every day, so if you want to get ahold of me for whatever reason, this is your best bet: (mark silver media at proton mail dot com
