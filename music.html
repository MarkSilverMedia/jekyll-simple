<p>I&#39;ve been releasing music that I write/record/produce/ &amp; whatnot since October of 2012, and to this day, my solo work remains my primary focus. It&#39;d be really hard for me to categorize it under any particular genre on account of the fact that I&#39;m quite often trying something new. In the future, I will have my entire discography linked from a static html page, but for now, here&#39;s a selection of links to different bandcamp pages where I&#39;ve released my solo work:</p>

<p><a href="https://marksilver.bandcamp.com/">Current/Main Discography</a></p>

<p><a href="https://marklive.bandcamp.com/">Live Performances</a></p>

<p><a href="https://silveralt.bandcamp.com/">Extra/Bonus Content and Alternative Pseudonyms</a></p>

<p><a href="https://silvermediaproductions.bandcamp.com/">Older/Legacy/Archive Discography</a></p>

<p>Be on the look out for my eponymous album, which will be released on the 22nd of August 2017. ;)</p>

<h4 id="the-groovy-galleon-2017-present">The Groovy Galleon (2017-Present)</h4>

<p><a href="https://marksilvermedia.github.io/groovygalleon">The Groovy Galleon</a> is both a libre-licensed music archive and alternative-music podcast, all rolled up into one nifty little markdown webspace. As of right now, it consists entirely of my own efforts, but I plan to bring some additional people, whether it be to feature their music or to talk with them on the podcast.</p>

<h4 id="emawm-2016-2017">EMAWM (2016-2017)</h4>

<p><a href="http://emawm.tk">"EMAWM"</a> (Extremely Musical Artists Will Musicalize) is a public demo archive where I, along with my good friends <a href="https://christophertom.bandcamp.com/">Chris</a> and <a href="https://spiffyflinger.bandcamp.com/">Josh</a>, posted work-in-progress music. You can still peruse the website and listen to a majority of its tracks, but this project is now dead as far as I&#39;m concerned, unless Chris or Josh choose to revive it. I totally want to collaborate with these guys again in the future on music-related stuff, but I don&#39;t see EMAWM being part of that.</p>

<h4 id="live-music---nerd-central--emawm-live-2015-present">Live Music - Nerd Central / EMAWM Live (2015-Present)</h4>

<p>Since late 2015, I&#39;ve done some skype performances with internet friends, mainly with the aforementioned EMAWM guys and <a href="http://tunes.wikipedia.sexy">April</a>. "<a href="http://nerdcentral.emawm.tk">Nerd Central</a>" pioneered the concept within the "Scratchbupers" niche before I became a member, and I&#39;d adapted the term for as long as I held ties to their members who aren&#39;t in EMAWM (The latest session was labeled "<a href="https://archive.org/details/el4117">EMAWM Live</a>").</p>
