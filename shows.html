<p>The Groovy Galleon Podcast is my first podcast! Started in June 2017, this podcast explores various aspects of music, whether it be discussion about tracks, albums, &amp; genres, or interviews with fellow musicians. The podcast can be found on <a href="https://marksilvermedia.github.io/groovygalleon/podcast">this page</a>.</p>

<h3 id="distrohopper-2016">Distrohopper (2016)</h3>

<p>Distrohopper was a fifteen episode linux distro overview series that I ran in the summer and early fall of 2016. Basically, I would take a look at a linux-based operating system for a week, and then give my thoughts about it. I ran this series on my now deleted YouTube channel, and it doesn&#39;t really pay for me to reupload the series somewhere because every distro I reviewed has since received an update, thus rendering the series obsolete, but I may post the ogg audio for the series on archive.org one of these days for the sake of recordkeeping (or something like that, right?).</p>
