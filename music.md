## Solo Work

I've been releasing music that I write/record/produce/ &amp; whatnot since October of 2012, and to this day, my solo work remains my primary focus. It'd be really hard for me to categorize it under any particular genre on account of the fact that I'm quite often trying something new. In the future, I will have my entire discography linked from a static html page, but for now, here's a selection of links to different bandcamp pages where I've released my solo work:

[Current/Main Discography](https://marksilver.bandcamp.com/)

[Live Performances](https://marklive.bandcamp.com/)

[Extra/Bonus Content and Alternative Pseudonyms](https://silveralt.bandcamp.com/)

[Older/Legacy/Archive Discography](https://silvermediaproductions.bandcamp.com/)

Be on the look out for my eponymous album, which will be released on the 22nd of August 2017. ;)

## Collaborative Work

### The Groovy Galleon (2017-Present)

[The Groovy Galleon](https://marksilvermedia.github.io/groovygalleon) is both a libre-licensed music archive and alternative-music podcast, all rolled up into one nifty little markdown webspace. As of right now, it consists entirely of my own efforts, but I plan to bring some additional people, whether it be to feature their music or to talk with them on the podcast. The podcast launches on June 24th!

### EMAWM (2016-2017)

["EMAWM"](http://emawm.tk) (Extremely Musical Artists Will Musicalize) is a public demo archive where I, along with my good friends [Chris](https://christophertom.bandcamp.com/) and [Josh](https://spiffyflinger.bandcamp.com/), posted work-in-progress music. You can still peruse the website and listen to a majority of its tracks, but this project is now dead as far as I'm concerned, unless Chris or Josh choose to revive it. I totally want to collaborate with these guys again in the future on music-related stuff, but I don't see EMAWM being part of that.

### Live Music - Nerd Central / EMAWM Live (2015-Present)

Since late 2015, I've done some skype performances with internet friends, mainly with the aforementioned EMAWM guys and [April](http://tunes.wikipedia.sexy). "[Nerd Central](http://nerdcentral.emawm.tk)" pioneered the concept within the "Scratchbupers" niche before I became a member, and I'd adapted the term for as long as I held ties to their members outside of EMAWM (The latest session was labeled "[EMAWM Live](https://archive.org/details/el4117)").
