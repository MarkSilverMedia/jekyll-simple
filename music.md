## Solo Work

I've been releasing music that I write/record/produce/ &amp; whatnot since October of 2012, and to this day, my solo work remains my primary focus. It'd be really hard for me to categorize it under any particular genre on account of the fact that I'm quite often trying something new. What follows is a selection of links to different bandcamp pages where I've released my solo work:

[Current/Main Discography](https://marksilver.bandcamp.com/)

[Live Performances](https://marklive.bandcamp.com/)

[Extra/Bonus Content and Alternative Pseudonyms](https://silveralt.bandcamp.com/)

[Older/Legacy/Archive Discography](https://silvermediaproductions.bandcamp.com/)

Be on the look out for my eponymous album, which will be released on the 22nd of August 2017. ;)

## Collaborative Work

### The Groovy Galleon

[The Groovy Galleon](https://marksilvermedia.github.io/groovygalleon) is both a libre-licensed music archive and a podcast, all rolled up into one nifty little markdown webspace. As of right now, it consists entirely of my own efforts, but I plan to bring some additional people, whether it be to feature their music or to talk with them on the podcast. This project fills the slot that EMAWM had before I began my hiatus from that project, and it will likely maintain my attention even if my friends and I resume posting on EMAWM.

### EMAWM

["EMAWM"](http://emawm.tk) (Extremely Musical Artists Will Musicalize) is a public demo archive where I, along with my good friends [Chris](https://christophertom.bandcamp.com/) and [Josh](https://spiffyflinger.bandcamp.com/), posted work-in-progress music. We're all currently on a sort of unspoken hiatus from this project for assorted reasons, but we may come out with a collaborative EP in the future. ;)

### Nerd Central / EMAWM Live

I've always described "Nerd Central" as the result of performing slick music in a skype call w/ your internet friends. The term was coined for this use in 2014 before I joined I had any involvement in it, and carried over into the sessions I recorded back when I used to be a member of the Scratchbupers group. All recordings using with "Nerd Central" in the title can be found [here](http://nerdcentral.emawm.tk/). I no longer use the alias now because I hadn't invited non-EMAWM Scratchbupers to our most recent session, which can be found both on this website and on EMAWM under the alias "EMAWM Live".
