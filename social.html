    <p>Being a bit of an internet hermit, I&#39;m not quite as social as I oughtta be. For the same reason, however, I am on social media. What follows is the list of social media sites and whatnot I&#39;m active on.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.joindiaspora.com/people/eeff12c050b00135bdc40242ac110007">Diaspora</a></b> - This one is pretty good. From the look of it, it reminds me a bit of the little I&#39;ve seen from facebook, but it has a few twists: It&#39;s decentralized, & it has an emphasis on following ideas (tags) instead of people, &amp; I think that&#39;s pretty cool. You should totally join me on here above anything else.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://mastodon.rocks/@MarkSilverMedia">Mastodon</a></strong> - It&#39;s twitter... but not really. This one&#39;s decentralised, so there&#39;s none of that censorship business. If you want short posts about random things in addition to my regular content, follow me over there.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.minds.com/MarkSilverMedia">Minds</a></strong> - Ah, yes. The shitpost memeland of the internetâ€¦ oh wait, that&#39;s 4chan. Minds is a pro-free-speech and open-sourced alternative to the likes of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube all rolled into one. If you&#39;re looking for a mix of sociopolitical memeing alongside my music and articles, feel free to follow me over there.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/MarkSilverMedia">Github</a></strong> - Not really a social network, but you can interact with me on here, so I&#39;ve put it on this page. As you may know, this website is hosted on Github. As you may also know, I do a bit of coding on an infrequent basis. If you like that kind of stuff, feel free to follow me or fork my repos or whatever you gitters want to do.</p>

<p><strong>Discord</strong> - One of my friends uses this to contact me, so I therefore have a presence here. Discord is a great alternative to Skype that is just better because Skype is owned by Microsoft and Microsoft is evil. If you want to be Discord friends, add me at MarkSilverMedia #6916.</p>

<p><strong>Email</strong> - When you average it out, I only log onto Discord about once a week. Email, however, I check every day, so if you want to get ahold of me for whatever reason, this is your best bet: mark silver media at proton mail dot com</p>
