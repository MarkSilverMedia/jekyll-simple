## The Groovy Galleon Podcast (2017-)

The Groovy Galleon Podcast will be my first podcast. Starting in June, this podcast will explore various aspects of music, whether it be discussion about tracks, albums, & genres, or interviews with fellow musicians. The podcast will be found on [this page](https://marksilvermedia.github.io/groovygalleon/podcast).

## Distrohopper (2016)

Distrohopper was a fifteen episode linux distro overview series that I ran in the summer and early fall of 2016. Basically, I would take a look at a linux-based operating system for a week, and then give my thoughts about it. I ran this series on my now deleted YouTube channel, and it doesn't really pay for me to reupload the series somewhere because every distro I reviewed has since received an update, thus rendering the series obsolete, but I may post the ogg audio for the series on archive.org one of these days for the sake of recordkeeping (or something like that, right?).
