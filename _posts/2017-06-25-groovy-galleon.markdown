Holy new podcast, Batman!

That's right, ladies & gentlemen (& attack helicopters & george w. bush)! I have a new podcast!

This podcast is the other half of the [Groovy Galleon](https://marksilvermedia.github.io/groovygalleon) project (the first half being a demo archive), and I FINALLY got around to launching it today! Do you like music? You should check this out! Do you like an overqualified bumbling idiot rambling on about music? Probably not, but you should check it out anyways!

Oh, yea. The podcast is linked [here](https://marksilvermedia.github.io/groovygalleon/podcast), yo. ;)
