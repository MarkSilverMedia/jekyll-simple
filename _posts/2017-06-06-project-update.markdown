Over the past few months (I think; I forget how long its been), I've been working on overhauling my website into a Markdown-friendly blog, and save for a page or two pages, that process is complete. I also moved the website over to my CNAME on github. There was really no point in me sacrifising security in my connection for the sake of using a top-level domain, so I ditched marksilvermedia.tk entirely.

In other news, I've got a few new things going that I want to unleash soon.
