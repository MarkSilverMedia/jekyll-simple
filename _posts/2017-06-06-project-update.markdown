Over the past few months (I think; I forget how long its been), I've been working on overhauling my website into a Markdown-friendly blog, and save for a page or two pages, that process is complete. I also moved the website over to my CNAME on github. There was really no point in me sacrifising security in my connection for the sake of using a top-level domain, so I ditched marksilvermedia.tk entirely.

In other news, I've got a few new things going that I want to unleash soon. First of all, I've got some additional articles and videos in the works. Some with a tech focus, and some more political. I figured that I'd get back in the loop of doing original long form posts more often, especially with this school year coming to a close. 

Additionally, I've got a [new website](https://marksilvermedia.github.io/groovygalleon) going for some informal music stuff. This new project is gonna be a way for me to post mostly demos of my music, but also will double as a podcast starting later this month (when I find the time to record the first episode). It's a little of a disorganised mess at the moment in my mind, and one function of the site could very well absorb the attention towards the other if my interest shifts. Mainly, I just want a microblog-esque place to share music-related stuff, so this should hopefully fill that void.

Speaking of music, I've got an album coming out on the 22nd of August. Instrumentals for all twelve tracks are done, and I intend to record the vocals during July. I may drop a sneak preview of a few of the tracks around my social media as a sort of promotion, but that of course won't do the album justice. Anyways, since I finished the instrumentals a few weeks ago, I've gotten around to writing some new material that could very well show up in my album after the one slated for August. I've added a new twist to my writing process that will hopefully be very satisfying in the long run, but more on that in an article I'll write for September.

The only other thing I have to cover today is the fact that I no longer have a social media presence on a certain big-three I mentioned in [this article](https://marksilvermedia.github.io/tech/article/2017/04/27/tech-communication.html). What sites *am* I on? You'll have to check out the new social tab on this website. ;)

That's all for today. I'll try to give these kinds of updates every other month, unless I have a reason to do so monthly, but we'll see. To paraphrase a certain Doc, the future hasn't been written yet.
