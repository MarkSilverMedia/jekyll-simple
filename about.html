<h2>About Me</h2>

It&#39;s Mark! (the exclamation point is silent)<br>
<br>
I&#39;m just some (sarcastic) guy on the internet that makes music, does stuff in linux (wow, ain&#39;t I a nerd?), and occasionally other things (podcasts, articles, code, politics/stupiditiy, etc). Navigating this website should help you find everything you may be looking for.<hr>
